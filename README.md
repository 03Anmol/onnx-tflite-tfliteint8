# onnx-tflite-tfliteint8
 

This is the repo in this repo I've trained resnet18 model using pytorch and converted its model into
1.onnx 
2.onnx-tflite fp32 
3.onnx-tflite fp16 
4.tflitefp16 to tflitefp8 int8

and infered the model to infer int8 model you need edge device and some compatibility which might your local system don't support
